# Codecs

FFglitch supports the following codecs for now:
- [`JPEG`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG)
- [`MPEG-2`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2)
- [`MPEG-4`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4)

I've written a brief overview of each codec so that you can have a
better idea of their inner workings, and therefore better understand
what is it that you are glitching:
- Go to [`JPEG` overview](mjpeg)
- Go to [`MPEG-2` overview](mpeg2)
- Go to [`MPEG-4` overview](mpeg4)
