# Codecs

FFglitch supports the following codecs for now:
- `JPEG`
- `MPEG-2`
- `MPEG-4`

I wanted to write an overview of each codec so that people could have
a better idea of their inner workings, and therefore better understand
what is it that they are glitching, but this turned out to be a massive
undertaking and ended up being too time-consuming and never-ending,
so I decided to indefinitely pause it. Unfortunately, it is in a
completely unfinished state. It should improve over time though.

- Go to [`JPEG` overview](mjpeg)
- Go to [`MPEG-2` overview](mpeg2)
- Go to [`MPEG-4` overview](mpeg4)
