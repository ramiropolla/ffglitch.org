# MPEG-2

[`MPEG-2`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2) is a very simple and
beautiful video codec. It used to be **THE THING** back in the late
90's and the days where DVDs reigned supreme.

It's still a good codec for glitching, since it's not very complex and
it's very resilient to corruption.
