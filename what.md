## What is FFglitch?

`FFglitch` is a **multimedia bitstream editor**, based on the open-source project [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/).

`FFglitch` allows you to very precisely edit multimedia files, down to the bitstream level.

`FFglitch` generates files with a **valid bitstream**. This means that VLC and Instagram **won't choke with your files**.

`FFglitch` can be used to create **codec art**.

Go check out the [Gallery](/gallery) page for some examples.

## What is FFlive?

`FFlive` is a **multimedia player**, the result of integrating `FFglitch` into FFplay (the video player part of the FFmpeg project).

`FFlive` can do everything `FFglitch` can, but during live playback.
