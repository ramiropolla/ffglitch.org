## Who?

Hi, I'm [Ramiro Polla](https://www.instagram.com/ramiropolla/).

I have always loved hacking things to learn and understand how they work.
I have always loved the technical aspects of any music-making or video-making thing.

I used to be an FFmpeg developer, and I was always amazed by the glitches that were created when we got something wrong in the code.
I loved to spend time experimenting with those glitches.
But since those glitches were considered bugs, and not features, we had to fix the bugs and get rid of the glitches.

FFglitch was born as a project where those glitches are features, and not bugs.

My technical skills tend to be better than my artistic skills.
I develop FFglitch mostly as a way to push the boundaries of my knowledge on the technical aspects of codecs.
The fact that artists use this tool to create amazing work is a bonus, and it always warms my heart to see them.
