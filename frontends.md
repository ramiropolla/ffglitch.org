FFglitch is widely-known for having very poor documentation, and
requiring a string of pharmaceutical-grade cryptic voodoo gobbledigook
command line switches and scripts. It's either that, or FFglitch is
**not** widely known mostly because of that.

Luckily, over the past few years many projects have popped up that use
FFglitch behind the scenes for some great datamoshing effects.

Here are some projects I stumbled upon. If you know of any others,
please let me know!

### Live Mosher by pawelzwronek

[`Live Mosher`](https://github.com/pawelzwronek/LiveMosher) is a very simple and
straight-forward `cross-platform` front-end for `FFglitch` written by
[pawelzwronek](https://github.com/pawelzwronek).

Just open `Live Mosher` and get started with `FFglitch` right away.
You have example scripts, a script editor, a playback interface, and that's it!

It includes scripts based on `dd_GlitchAssist` below.

### dd_GlitchAssist by Daz Disley

[dd_GlitchAssist](http://dazdisley.co.uk/#!/page:./dd_GlitchAssist/)
is a small windows gui front-end for FFglitch written by Daz Disley.

It includes more than 150 scripts for applying different styles of
bastardisation to your video. Check out this demo:

<div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0j_tD54Dsvk?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>

### Datamosh 2 by Danny Perry

[Datamosh 2](https://aescripts.com/datamosh/) is an After Effects
plugin that allows you to break video files in countless fashions,
mostly by using FFglitch behind the scenes.

They did quite a good job making FFglitch more accessible for people
that are used to After Effects and that are not used to command line
gobbledigook. It's a paid product though. So, if you're feeling like
cashing out on fifty bucks, go nuts:

<div class='embed-container'><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aJpDIu4P9QY?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>

### glitchbox-cli by Jakub Kopa≈Ñko

[glitchbox-cli](https://github.com/pcktm/glitchbox-cli) is a
command line interface to easily glitch video files with code.
It still has some gobbledigook, but overall it's simpler than pure
FFglitch.

### Datamoshing in python by Tiberiu Iancu

[Datamoshing in python](https://github.com/tiberiuiancu/datamoshing) is
another command line interface to simplify using FFglitch using Python.
It includes some of the scripts from dd_GlitchAssist and a couple more
original scripts.

### Datamoshing-GUI by CubeZeero

[Datamoshing-GUI](https://github.com/CubeZeero/datamoshing_GUI) is a
fork of Datamoshing in python that includes a Graphical User Interface.
It contains a similar set of scripts and effects as above.

### Datamosher Pro by Akascape

[Datamosher Pro](https://pythonrepo.com/repo/Akascape-Datamosher-Pro-python-video)
is another python Graphical User Interface that includes some of the
scripts from dd_GlitchAssist and a couple more original scripts.
