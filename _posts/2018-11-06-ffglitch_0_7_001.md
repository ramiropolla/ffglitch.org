FFglitch 0.7.001 has been released.

A [new release branch](https://github.com/ramiropolla/ffglitch-core/tree/ffedit-0.7)
has been created, rebased on top of [FFmpeg 4.0.3](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/tree/n4.0.3).

The biggest change in this new branch is that the modified prerequisites
[xvidcore](https://labs.xvid.com) (version 1.3.5)
and
[json-c](https://github.com/json-c/json-c) (version 0.13.1-20180305)
are now bundled with FFglitch, simplifying the build process.

Other changes include:
* The ordering of frames in the output JSON file has been fixed (mpeg2/4 videos with bi-directional frames are now supported);
* A sha1sum of the input file has been added to the output JSON file;
* The builds in the Downloads page are now 64-bit, since some big input files caused out-of-memory errors;
* macOS builds have been added to the Downloads page.

Get it in the [Download]({{ "/download" | relative_url }}) page.
