FFglitch 0.9.4 has been released.

Python3
=======

The main change in this version is the addition of `python3` scripting
support. This way you don't need to use the old three-step method of
`export`/`glitch`/`apply` for your Python scripts anymore. It can all
be done in one go, just like it was already possible with `javascript`
since [version 0.9.1]({% post_url 2020-07-13-ffglitch_0_9_1 %}).

For example, the
[Simple motion vector tutorial]({% post_url 2020-07-13-mv %})
in `python3` would be:
```py
def glitch_frame(frame):
    # bail out if we have no motion vectors
    if not "mv" in frame:
        return
    # bail out if we have no forward motion vectors
    if not "forward" in frame["mv"]:
        return
    fwd_mvs = frame["mv"]["forward"]

    # loop through all rows
    for row in fwd_mvs:
        # loop through all macroblocks
        for mv in row:
            # clear horizontal element of all motion vectors

            # THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS

            mv[0] = 0; # this sets the horizontal motion vector to zero
            # mv[1] = 0; # you could also change the vertical motion vector
```
```bash
$ ./ffedit -i temp_file.mpg -f mv -s mv_sink_and_rise.py -o glitched_file.mpg
```

**NOTE**: You have to install Python3 yourself! Get it from their website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Script video filter
===================

A script video filter has been added, supporting both JavaScript and
Python, so that you can edit the pixels of a video programmatically.
You can chain the filter on top of an existing video or create a video
from scratch.
For example, create this file named `uv.py`:

```py
def filter(args):
  data = args["data"]
  # planes are [ Y, U, V ]
  for p, plane in enumerate(data):
    # skip plane Y
    if p == 0:
      continue
    # for planes U and V, draw a color plane
    for i, row in enumerate(plane):
      for j in range(len(row)):
        if p == 1:
          row[j] = j+j
        else:
          row[j] = 254-(i+i)
```

and then run it on top of the `testsrc2` video source from `FFmpeg`:

```bash
$ ffgac -f lavfi -i "testsrc2=duration=10:size=256x256,script=py=uv.py" -q 0 -y testsrc2_uv.mp4
```

and you'll end up with this nice video:

<video preload="auto" loop autoplay muted controls width="100%">
  <source src="/assets/images/testsrc2_uv.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Motion Vector Delta Feature
===========================

Motion vectors values are composed of a `pred`iction part and a
`delta` part, which is the value that is written to the bitstream.

A new feature named `"mv_delta"` has been added to ffedit, which
allows you to fiddle with only those `delta` values for both
`MPEG-2` and `MPEG-4`.

There is no example for this feature for now.
This is left as an exercise for the reader.

Motion Vector Overflow
======================

There is now greater control on how `ffedit` should behave when it
encounters an overflow in either the `"mv"` or the `"mv_delta"` features.
Three more values are exported, namely `"fcode"`, `"bcode"` and `"overflow"`.

The first two are for information purposes only and allow you to calculate
the min and max values for your motion vectors if you wish.
For `MPEG-2` the values go from `-(1<<(fcode+3))` to `(1<<(fcode+3))-1`,
and for `MPEG-4` the values go from `-(1<<(fcode+4))` to `(1<<(fcode+4))-1`,
which, for an `fcode` of `1`, would range from `[-16, 15]` for `MPEG-2`
and `[-32, 31]` for `MPEG-4` (keep in mind that those are half-pel values).

The `"overflow"` field tells `ffedit` how to behave when it encounters
an overflow while transplicating a file. The four possible values are
as follows:
```js
  frame["mv"]["overflow"] = "assert";   // quits ffedit on overflow
  frame["mv"]["overflow"] = "truncate"; // truncates values within range for given fcode
  frame["mv"]["overflow"] = "ignore";   // just ignore the overflow - same behaviour as versions before 0.9.4
  frame["mv"]["overflow"] = "warn";     // ignore, like above, but also write a warning message - new default behaviour
```

I'm too lazy to write an example for now.
This is also left as an exercise for the reader.

ffglitch.js
===========

A new executable called `qjs` (or `qjs.exe` for Windows) has been added
to the release bundle, along with a new file `ffglitch.js`. `qjs` is the
[quickjs](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) command-line interpreter. It can
be used to test your `.js` scripts. `ffglitch.js` It works similarly to
`ffglitch.py`, but for `javascript` files. To use it, run something like:
```bash
  $ ./qjs ffglitch.js -i mv.json -s mv_sink_and_rise.js -o mv_glitched.json
```

More changes
============

- Speedup exporting of JSON data by up to 40%
- Speedup importing of JSON data by up to 80%
- Added `"macroblock"` feature to `MPEG-4` (works the same way as it did for `MPEG-2`)
- Fixed `-dqt` option for non-mjpeg (broken in `0.9.3`)
- Updated [quickjs](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) to quickjs-2021-03-27

My build system has changed
===========================

I now have a mac mini running Mojave and I build the macos version there.
If it doesn't run on older versions of macos please let me know and I'll
try to figure out a way to fix it.

The linux build no longer uses musl, but is built on a CentOS 7 image,
which should run correctly on most modern distros.
