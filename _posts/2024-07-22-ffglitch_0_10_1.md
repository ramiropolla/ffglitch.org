`FFglitch` 0.10.1 has been released.

It brings one main new feature: `PNG` (and `APNG`) support!

Other changes include:
* switch from [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/) to [zlib-ng](https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng) (for better performance);
* add pipe support to export/apply json files;
* fix build to include video capture support.

PNG:
====

There are two new ways to glitch `PNG` and `APNG` files.

### ffgac

You can glitch `PNG` and `APNG` with scripts directly while encoding
them, by using the new `-filter_row_script` option.

Follow the example script from the
[PNG and APNG encoding]({{ "/docs/0.10.1/ffgac/#png-and-apng-encoding" | relative_url }})
link to encode files like this:

### ffedit

You can edit values in `PNG` and `APNG` files much the same way that
you can edit them with other codecs supported by FFglitch.
The features for `PNG` and `APNG` are described in
[PNG features]({{ "/docs/0.10.1/features/png" | relative_url }}).

With the following script (apng_fctl.js):

```js
const APNG_DISPOSE_OP_NONE       = 0;
const APNG_DISPOSE_OP_BACKGROUND = 1;
const APNG_DISPOSE_OP_PREVIOUS   = 2;
const APNG_BLEND_OP_SOURCE = 0;
const APNG_BLEND_OP_OVER   = 1;
export function setup(args)
{
  args.features = [ "headers" ];
}
export function glitch_frame(frame, stream)
{
  const fctl = frame.headers.fcTL;
  if ( !fctl )
    return;
  fctl.dispose_op = APNG_DISPOSE_OP_NONE;
  fctl.blend_op   = APNG_BLEND_OP_OVER;
}
```

and the following command line:

```bash
ffedit -i input.apng -s apng_fctl.js -o output.apng
```

you can get the following animation:

to become like this:

Live capture:
=============

How come nobody complained so far that live capture support wasn't enabled?
Has nobody been using `webcams` and `HDMI capture` for live glitching?

It's amazing, you should all try it...
Or maybe I should write a tutorial on how to do it first...

Thanks to:

I would like to thank [Avery Chester](https://www.facebook.com/eim.ghay.5)
for the idea of glitching `PNG` and `APNG` files.

I would also like to thank
[Jared Bruni](https://www.facebook.com/lostsidedead)
(the author of
[Acid Cam](https://github.com/lostjared/acidcamGL) and
[Glitch.GUI](https://github.com/lostjared/glitch.gui))
for being a source of inspiration on perseverance and dedication in the
Glitch Artists Community.
His daily posts about his projects and frequent releases and
publications keep reminding me not to slack off on FFglitch
development myself.
