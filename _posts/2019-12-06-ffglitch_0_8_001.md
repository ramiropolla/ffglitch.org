FFglitch 0.8.001 has been released.

A [new release branch](https://github.com/ramiropolla/ffglitch-core/tree/ffedit-0.8)
has been created, rebased on top of the latest FFmpeg git (commit `d5274f86`).

The biggest change in this new branch is that `ffglitch` should now
be capable of working with files greater than 1 minute.

The main issue was that the `json-c` library used waaaaay too much
memory and was too slow. Therefore I have reinvented the wheel and
reimplemented a JSON parser in C from scratch, which is much faster
and uses much less memory.

Other changes include:
* xvidcore has been updated to version 1.3.6;
* There were some improvements in the ffglitch.py script;

Get it in the [Download]({{ "/download" | relative_url }}) page.
