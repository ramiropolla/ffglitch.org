FFglitch 0.9.3 has been released.

The main change is the renaming of the `ffmpeg` build that comes with
`ffglitch` from `ffmpeg` to `ffgac`, to prevent confusion with the real
`ffmpeg`.

For those that didn't know it, `ffmpeg` stands for `fast forward MPEG`,
where `MPEG` stands for `Moving Picture Experts Group`, which I have
always found a silly and pompous name. `ffgac` is meant for glitch
artists, where the `GAC` stands for
[`Glitch Artists Collective`](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Glitchcollective/).

`ffgac` contains some extra options that make it easier to create
glitchable videos. None of those options are documented so far, but
I plan on writing blog posts about them.

Other changes in 0.9.3 are:
- Fixed exporting JSON data and transplication of AVI files;
- Minor memory-related bug fixes;
- Added `-dqt` option to `ffgac` to force a quantization table for `JPEG` files.

Get it in the [Download]({{ "/download" | relative_url }}) page.
