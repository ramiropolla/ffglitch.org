`FFglitch` 0.10.2 has been released.

This is more of a structural release, with many changes under the hood:
* Lots of speed optimizations for arm64 (for [Apple silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon) and [SBCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) like the Raspberry Pi 5);
* Improved network communication and messaging support on JavaScript using ZeroMQ (the [documentation for ZeroMQ]({{ "docs/0.10.2/quickjs/zeromq" | relative_url }}) has also been improved);
* The standalone QuickJS is much more powerful with built-in MIDI input and networking support;
* Added X11 and Wayland capture to Linux builds;
* Fixed build for arm64 macOS;
* Fixed some bugs with DHT and DQT on JPEGs.

Tutorial
========

There is a tutorial being developed collaboratively at the [`ffglitch-scripts`](https://github.com/ramiropolla/ffglitch-scripts) repository here:
[https://github.com/ramiropolla/ffglitch-scripts/tree/main/tutorial](https://github.com/ramiropolla/ffglitch-scripts/tree/main/tutorial)

It's still a work-in-progress, so you are encouraged to
[start a discussion](https://github.com/ramiropolla/ffglitch-scripts/discussions),
[open an issue](https://github.com/ramiropolla/ffglitch-scripts/issues), or
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/ramiropolla/ffglitch-scripts/pulls).
The idea is to make `FFglitch` more accessible for first-time users.
