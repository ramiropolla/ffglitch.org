There is a new `FFglitch`
[front-end]({{ "/frontends" | relative_url }})
in town!

It's called
[`Live Mosher`](https://github.com/pawelzwronek/LiveMosher),
and it has been created by
[pawelzwronek](https://github.com/pawelzwronek).

Just open [`Live Mosher`](https://github.com/pawelzwronek/LiveMosher)
and get started with `FFglitch` right away.
You have example scripts, a script editor, a playback interface, and that's it!

There is no more need to deal with complicated pharmaceutical-grade cryptic
voodoo gobbledigook command line switches!

`Live Mosher` works on `Windows`, `macOS`, and `Linux`.
