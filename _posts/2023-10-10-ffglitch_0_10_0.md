This release of FFglitch is dedicated to the memory of my therapist, Sonia de Lima, who passed away in 2022.
She never understood what this project was, but always supported me working on it.

New major release:
==================

`FFglitch` 0.10.0 has (**finally**) been released.

It brings major changes in functionality, new features, and performance:
- The introduction of a new program called `FFlive`, which is a **multimedia player** that integrates `FFglitch`.
- Input support through **MIDI controllers**, **keyboard/mouse**, **network**, etc.
- Improved performance allowing up to **4K** glitching in **real-time**.
- `MOV` file format support.
- Pixel sorting, because why not?

FFlive:
=======

The biggest change is the introduction of a new program called `FFlive`.
It is a **multimedia player** that integrates `FFglitch`, allowing for
multimedia glitching in real-time.

Input support:
==============

Input support has been added through **MIDI controllers**, **keyboard/mouse**,
**network**, etc.

This means it is possible to control the parameters of your scripts in real-time,
while also allowing multiple instances of `FFglitch`/`FFlive` to connect to each other.

Documentation:
==============

I managed to get some documentation written. This should help people out on
figuring out how to use `FFglitch`/`FFlive`.

There is also a new github repository with samples scripts which you can freely
use as a source of inspiration for writing your own scripts:
[FFglitch scripts repository](https://github.com/ramiropolla/ffglitch-scripts)

(the repository is pretty chaotic though)
