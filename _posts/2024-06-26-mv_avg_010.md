title: "Average motion vector tutorial (0.10)"

A [previous post]({% post_url 2020-07-17-mv_avg %}) gave an average
tutorial on how to glitch motion vectors by using an average of motion
vectors.

A lot has changed since then, and `ffglitch` (starting with
[version `0.10.0`]({% post_url 2024-06-09-ffglitch_0_10_0 %}))
now has optimized code to speed up array manipulations and calculations
in `JavaScript`.
You can check out [the documentation](/docs/0.10.0/quickjs) (yes, there
is documentation now!) to check the full extent of the added
functionality.

Here's the original video again:

<video preload="auto" loop autoplay muted controls width="100%">
  <source src="/assets/images/trompette_eating.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

And the optimized script `mv_average_010.js`:

```js
// global variable holding forward motion vectors from previous frames
let prev_fwd_mvs = [ ];
let total_sum;

// change this value to use a smaller or greater number of frames to
// perform the average of motion vectors
// you can also change it using the `-sp <num>` command line option
let tail_length = 10;
let tail_length_mv;

export function setup(args)
{
    // select motion vector feature
    args.features = [ "mv" ];

    // parse tail_length param from command line if available
    if ( "params" in args )
        tail_length = args.params;
    tail_length_mv = MV(tail_length, tail_length);
}

export function glitch_frame(frame)
{
    // bail out if we have no forward motion vectors
    const fwd_mvs = frame.mv?.forward;
    if ( !fwd_mvs )
        return;

    // set motion vector overflow behaviour in ffedit to "truncate"
    frame.mv.overflow = "truncate";

    // update variable holding forward motion vectors from previous
    // frames. note that we perform a deep copy of the clean motion
    // vector values before modifying them.
    const deep_copy = fwd_mvs.dup();
    // push to the end of array
    prev_fwd_mvs.push(deep_copy);

    // initialize total_sum to a [0,0] MV2DArray.
    if ( !total_sum )
        total_sum = new MV2DArray(fwd_mvs.width, fwd_mvs.height);

    // update total_sum by removing the motion vector values from the
    // oldest frame and adding the values from the current frame.
    if ( prev_fwd_mvs.length > tail_length )
    {
        total_sum.sub(prev_fwd_mvs[0]);
        prev_fwd_mvs = prev_fwd_mvs.slice(1);
    }
    total_sum.add(deep_copy);

    // set new values for current frame to (total_sum / tail_length)
    if ( prev_fwd_mvs.length == tail_length )
    {
        fwd_mvs.assign(total_sum);
        fwd_mvs.div(tail_length_mv);
    }
}
```

Now run `ffedit` with `mv_average_010.js` to glitch the file:
```bash
$ ffedit -i trompette_eating.mpg -s mv_average_010.js -sp 10 -o trompette_eating_glitched.mpg
```

(note the `-sp 10` script parameter, which can be used to set `tail_length` inside the script from the command line.
check the [`ffedit` documentation](/docs/0.10.0/ffedit) for more information on command line parameters)

And this is the resulting `trompette_eating_glitched.mpg`:

<video preload="auto" loop autoplay muted controls width="100%">
  <source src="/assets/images/trompette_eating_glitched.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Prior to `0.10.0`, with the old version of the script, I used to get
around `15 fps`.
With the optimized script, I get around `300 fps`.

That's a whopping `20x` speedup!
