FFglitch 0.9.2 has been released.

This minor release fixes a bug that prevented FFglitch from working on
Windows with anything but tiny files, and also fixes some huge memory
leaks that prevented FFglitch from working with big files.

Another bug introduced in 0.9.1 could skip processing some I frames.

Also a progress report has been added (just like FFmpeg has) so that
you get some kind of feedback and know that things aren't stalled.

Get it in the [Download]({{ "/download" | relative_url }}) page.
