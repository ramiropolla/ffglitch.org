I'm pushing out a release before going to [/'fu:bar/ 2018](https://fubar.space/) so that people have something to play with...

Get it in the [Download]({{ "/download" | relative_url }}) page.

In the meantime, check out the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ffglitch/) (there's nothing much going on there either...).
