Introduction
============

One of the most used features of `ffglitch` is the ability to tinker
around with motion vectors in [MPEG-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2)
files.

I'm not going to go in full details explaining what [motion vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_vector)
are but basically they describe movements between frames in video files.
If we alter those values, we can make all sorts of funky glitches.

In this post I will show how to do this with a very simple script.

0 - Generate input file
=======================

First and foremost, we want to be playing around with a file that does
have motion vectors. Usually the encoder will not write motion vectors
to the bitstream if there are no motion vectors to write (duh), but we
want to force them everywhere. We also want to force that no I
macroblocks will be written to the bitstream in P frames (no need to
understand this now). We also want to make sure we have a long run of
P frames, because I frames effectively deglitch the video, and we
don't want that to happen.

All of this preparation can be done with the modified `ffmpeg` build
that comes with `ffglitch` (called `ffgac`). Run the following command line, replacing
***input_file*** with the original video file you want to glitch, and
***temp_file.mpg*** with a filename that will be used as your input to
glitch.

```bash
$ ffgac -i input_file -an -mpv_flags +nopimb+forcemv -qscale:v 0 -g max -sc_threshold max -vcodec mpeg2video -f rawvideo -y temp_file.mpg
```

Great! Now you have an MPEG-2 file ready to be glitched (it's `temp_file.mpg`).

For this tutorial, I will use the [Rush Hour Traffic Circa 1956](https://archive.org/details/CEP00109)
public domain video.

1 - Glitch file with Javascript
===============================

To glitch the file using `ffglitch`'s native scripting capabilities
(made possible by integrating [quickjs](https://bellard.org/quickjs)),
you will have to write code in Javascript.

This file should have a function called `glitch_frame`, which will
be called once for each frame.

The `frame` object passed to `glitch_frame` will have an object
for each feature that was requested (in our case, `mv` for motion vectors),
and we modify them directly.

The motion vector object might have a `backward` object if we are
dealing with B frames (ignore this for now), and might have a
`forward` object for P frames (this is what we will use).

In the `backward` or `forward` objects, there will be one array
for each row of macroblocks, and these arrays will each have
one array of 2 values (for horizontal and vertical motion vectors),
for each macroblock.

The structure for motion vectors in `frame` looks like this:
```
"mv": {
    "forward": [
        [ [ x, y ], [ x, y ], ..., [ x, y ] ],
        [ [ x, y ], [ x, y ], ..., [ x, y ] ],
        [ [ x, y ], [ x, y ], ..., [ x, y ] ],
        ...
        [ [ x, y ], [ x, y ], ..., [ x, y ] ]
    ],
    "backward": [
        [ [ x, y ], [ x, y ], ..., [ x, y ] ],
        [ [ x, y ], [ x, y ], ..., [ x, y ] ],
        [ [ x, y ], [ x, y ], ..., [ x, y ] ],
        ...
        [ [ x, y ], [ x, y ], ..., [ x, y ] ]
    ]
}
```

With all that being said, here's the script that we will be using.
Save it as a file named `mv_sink_and_rise.js`:

```js
function glitch_frame(frame)
{
    // bail out if we have no motion vectors
    let mvs = frame["mv"];
    if ( !mvs )
        return;
    // bail out if we have no forward motion vectors
    let fwd_mvs = mvs["forward"];
    if ( !fwd_mvs )
        return;

    // clear horizontal element of all motion vectors
    for ( let i = 0; i < fwd_mvs.length; i++ )
    {
        // loop through all rows
        let row = fwd_mvs[i];
        for ( let j = 0; j < row.length; j++ )
        {
            // loop through all macroblocks
            let mv = row[j];

            // THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENS

            mv[0] = 0; // this sets the horizontal motion vector to zero
            // mv[1] = 0; // you could also change the vertical motion vector
        }
    }
}
```

Now run `ffedit` with `mv_sink_and_rise.js` to glitch the file:
```bash
$ ./ffedit -i temp_file.mpg -f mv -s mv_sink_and_rise.js -o glitched_file.mpg
```

And this is the resulting `glitched_file.mpg`:

Conclusion
==========

I don't like writing posts with introductions and conclusions, but
since there was an introduction section, there is also a conclusion
section.

Go wild with your scripts and glitch the fuck out of those motion vectors...
