Hi, and welcome to FFglitch.

I used to have a wiki with FFglitch information, but it got hacked, so now I'm trying a static blog.

There isn't much here yet, but I plan to write some posts (this is the point of having a blog, isn't it?).

You can already download it in the [Download]({{ "/download" | relative_url }}) page.

In the meantime, check out the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ffglitch/).
